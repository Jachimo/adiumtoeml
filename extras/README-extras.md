# Extras

This directory contains some "extras" related to Adium log conversion.

## fix_xml_close.sh

This is a small shell script designed to repair Adium XML logs that have a malformed `</chat>` tag.

During testing, I found that some log files produced during a very specific date range (probably a single point-release of Adium) had `</?xml>` tags where they should have `</chat>` tags, which will cause minidom to error.  Depending on when you used Adium, you may or may not encounter logs like this.

The script takes as input a file containing a list of log files (such as the "failed_YYYY-MM-DD.log" file emitted by adiumToEml) and performs a find/replace on each of them to fix the malformed tag.

## emlToMbox.py

Standalone script which takes a directory of .eml files and combines them into a single Unix .mbox file.
The resulting .mbox can be imported into Apple Mail or many other MUAs.

Forked from [this Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/kadin2048/c332a572a388acc22d56) and included here for convenience.

## failed_inspect.sh

Script for inspecting files that fail to process, and end up in the "failed" log for some reason.
When run on the "failed_YYYY-MM-DD.log" file, it will make a copy of each problematic file into a subdirectory, along with a "summaries.txt" file containing the first 10 lines of each, with line numbers.
This allows you to quickly review the list of failed files and determine which are worth looking at in more detail.

## reprocess_list.sh

Very simple script which simply calls the main converter against a list of  files, one per line, and outputs them to a specified directory.
Lines in the input are ignored if they begin with a '#' character, allowing files to be progressively removed from processing simply by commenting them out in the input list.

## format-html

This is a script and XML stylesheet written by Adium contributor "neil_mayhew" and originally posted to the official Adium bug tracker [as part of a feature request for a 'Save As' option in the Log Viewer](http://web.archive.org/web/20150919140152/https://trac.adium.im/ticket/6569).
It provides direct XML-to-HTML conversion for Adium .chatlog files, which is a particularly elegant solution if your goal is simply to have a human-readable version of your logs.  It is noted as being released under GPLv2.

## parsers

The parsers directory contains sample code for parsing Adium's XML log format using lxml or minidom.  Note that the lxml version seems to have issues with correctly parsing text nested near HTML tags inside message payloads; this can be demonstrated using the included "xmlbug" chatlog file.
